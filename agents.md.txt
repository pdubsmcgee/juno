DeltaVinci — Juno: New Origins Flight Software Agent
1. Operating Mode

This agent operates in:

Adversarial Self-Verification Mode

Syntax Lock Mode

Repository-Grounded Knowledge Mode

The agent must not:

Invent Vizzy commands

Invent toolkit properties

Invent telemetry fields

Assume behavior from other games (e.g., KSP)

Modify XML structure without validation

If uncertain:

Stop

Mark item as UNVERIFIED

Request evidence or clarification

2. Scope

The agent is responsible for:

Maintaining and updating Vizzy XML programs

Building a verified knowledge database of Vizzy syntax and commands

Making safe structural edits to XML exports

Preserving behavioral correctness

The agent is NOT responsible for:

Guessing undocumented functionality

Speculating about unsupported Vizzy features

Refactoring unrelated logic without explicit instruction

3. Repository Structure (Fill After Initial Scan)
XML Programs

Path(s):

File count:

Schema version(s):

Documentation Sources

Markdown files:

Example programs:

Notes:

Tools Directory

tools/parse_vizzy_xml.*

tools/edit_vizzy_xml.*

tools/validate_vizzy_xml.*

4. Verified Vizzy Knowledge

This section is populated ONLY from repository evidence.

4.1 Verified Commands

(Reference vizzy_kb/commands.json)

 set nav heading to

 set nav pitch to

 set throttle to

 wait

 wait until

 forever

 if / end

 break

 stop

 sqrt

 abs

Each entry must include:

Evidence file path

XML node identifier

Notes on usage constraints

4.2 Verified Telemetry Fields

(Reference vizzy_kb/telemetry.json)

Examples:

apoapsis

periapsis

speed

vertical speed

Mass

MaxEngineThrust

time to apoapsis

gravity

planetRadius

Each must include repo evidence.

4.3 Verified Navigation Modes

prograde

retrograde

heading/pitch mode

All entries require XML evidence.

5. XML Structural Understanding

(Updated as discovered)

Node Model

Node ID format:

Port naming convention:

How links are represented:

Variable storage structure:

Loop representation:

Conditional representation:

6. Knowledge Database Rules

The agent must:

Store verified commands in vizzy_kb/commands.json

Store verified telemetry fields in vizzy_kb/telemetry.json

Store control-flow patterns in vizzy_kb/patterns.md

Store XML schema findings in vizzy_kb/xml_schema.md

Each entry must include:

Evidence reference (file + location)

Confidence level

Notes

No entry may be added without repo-backed evidence.

7. XML Modification Protocol

Before editing:

Parse XML into internal graph

Validate:

Node IDs unique

All links valid

All referenced variables exist

Apply minimal diff changes

Re-validate structure

Output change summary:

Nodes added

Nodes modified

Nodes removed

Variables affected

Never:

Rename variables unless requested

Reorder unrelated nodes

Delete nodes not explicitly targeted

8. Circularization / Burn Math Standard

All orbital math must follow:

r = planetRadius + apoapsis
μ = gravity × planetRadius²
v_circ = sqrt(μ / r)
Δv = v_circ − speed
t_burn = (Δv × Mass) / MaxEngineThrust
burnStart = t_burn / 2

If units cannot be verified:

Stop and investigate

9. Change Log

Every time the agent:

Adds verified commands

Discovers new telemetry

Modifies XML

Changes architecture assumptions

It must append a short entry:

[DATE]
Action:
Files affected:
Summary:
Evidence source:
10. Open Unknowns

Items that have been requested but are not yet verified in repo:

[ ]

[ ]

[ ]

No assumptions may be made about these.

11. Initialization Procedure

When agent runs for first time:

Scan repo for *.xml files

Scan for markdown/docs referencing Vizzy

Build initial knowledge base

Populate Verified sections

Report:

XML file count

Verified command count

Verified telemetry count

Unknown items

12. Failure Policy

If XML cannot be parsed:

Do not modify file

Report structural issue

Suggest corrective action

If command cannot be verified:

Mark UNVERIFIED

Do not use in edits
